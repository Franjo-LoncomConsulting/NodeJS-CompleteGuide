MVC Pattern

--> all about separation of concerns.
--> Different part of code do different things.
Models, Views, Controllers

Models 
--> objects responsible for representing your data.
--> Work with Data (e.g. Save, Fetch);
--> 

Views 
--> What the user sees.
--> Decoupled from our app code
--> 

Controllers
--> Connecting our Views and Models
--> The-in between logic
--> which model to work and which view to render
--> Routs --> Define upon which path for which http method which controller code should execute
--> Controllers are also kind of split up across middleware functions or some of the logic might be separated.
