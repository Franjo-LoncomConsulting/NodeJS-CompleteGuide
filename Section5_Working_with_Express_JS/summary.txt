Middleware next() and res()

--> Express relies heavily on middleware functions - you can easily add them by calling use()
--> Middleware functions handle a request and should call next() to forward the request to the next function in line or send a response

Routing
--> You can filter requests by path and method 
--> If you filter by method, paths are matched exactly, otherwise, the first segment of a URL is matched
--> You can use the express.Router to split your routes across files elegantely

Serve files
--> Send files to the user with sendFile() - e.g. HTML files
--> If a request is directly made for a file (e.g. a static css file is requested), we can enable static serving for such a files via express.static()
